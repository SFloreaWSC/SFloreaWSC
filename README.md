### Hello, you
#

In the past, I have created websites using HTML and CSS. The said websites were a 10KA (year 10 core class) class yearbook website and a text based adventure game made using websites crated with just HTML and CSS. I also used python to create a simple snake game and javascript to make part of a game, though I can't say I remember much of either.

When I was a kid, I always admired people who could create things with code; games, websites, software, ect. And I always wanted to create things like that, and even though online tools can be helpful, a class that has structured learning with goals and assignments is much more helpful to my learning. 

My cat's name Dr. Tigger Pepper Von Meowington the 3rd ESQ, and less importantly my name is Sebastian Florea. I think that I work the best by myself, although I do like managing other people and the work they are doing, sometimes it can cause quite a bit of stress when I'm managing too much.
I like the Secret garden, both the book and the 1993 edition movie, and I also like A Series Of Unfortunate Events. My favorite subjects were Science and Digital Tech, specifically Chemistry and websites were my favorites since I was good at both.

In the future, I would love to develop some form of survival based game with optional story elements. Other than that small goal, a larger aspirtation I would be intrested in developing software for users as either a profession or as a hobby.
